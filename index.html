                <p>The Demon Slayer Corps have been fighting demons for almost 1,000 years in hopes of finally defeating the demon king, Muzan Kibutsuji. To end this relentless war, we need <b>your</b> help. KNYDEX is a guide to teach and inform you about the slayers, demons, and breathing techniques before you start your training. Using KNYDEX, we will also decide the breathing technique that is best suited for you. Remember that this journey will be a rough one, but you are far more capable than you think.</p>

                <p><b>Sanemi Shinazugawa</b> is the current Wind Pillar of the Demon Slayer Corps. He is known for his aggressive and volatile nature, being hot-tempered, blunt, and often cruel with his words, especially toward those he believes are weak. He has spiky white hair, sharp eyes, and a body covered in scars from countless battles with demons. Despite this harsh exterior, he deeply cares for others. He harbors an intense hatred for demons due to the trauma of his past. Sanemi’s fighting style is wild and relentless, matching his Wind Breathing techniques. Beneath his rage, he is a deeply wounded and loyal man who bears his pain in silence.</p>
